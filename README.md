Welcome to our Check_MK documentation.

The documentation provided here is meant as an introduction to the Check_MK Enterprise Edition (CEE). The majority of the information here should apply to the open source (RAW) versions as well.

If you find mistakes or feel you could contribute in helping us provide better documentation please dive in.

This project is not meant to be the definitive Check_MK documentation. The official Check_MK documentation is
